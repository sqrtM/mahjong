# mahjong

just a bit of mahjong. wanted to make a client for this for a long time and figured it'd be a good excuse to play with some full stack stuff.

The goal : mahjong client created entirely in html elements, held in the server (so no cheating 🤥).


made with encore — php for the back and typescript-react for the front.
