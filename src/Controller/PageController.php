  /**
   * The problem we're having is that we cannot seem
   * to keep the data we're generating consistent.
   * There are two options : 
   * Send it all to the users (a bit dangerous, but easier)
   * Or set up a database to hold the data so it's not local
   * 
   * I think we'll end up with the db approach. It's fast enough and once it's called,
   * it would allow the users to return to the game after refreshing or something. 
   * 
   * SO:
   * @todo set up a postgres db. Get all the env stuff running.
   * The table should be something like :
   * ROOM ID | DECK* | TURN | EAST HAND | NORTH HAND | WEST HAND | SOUTH HAND | EAST DISCARD | NORTH DISCARD | WEST DISCARD | SOUTH DISCARD | EAST SCORE | NORTH SCORE | WEST SCORE | SOUTH SCORE 
   * 
   * * We MUST find a way to serialize this shit. This is being sent a huge raw JSON and there's really no reason to do that.
   * We should allow the user to actually do all the calculations. Maybe, instead of the server giving a fuck about the cards,
   * The server just sends a string of characters which coorespond to the ASCII char for each tile ? Or even just a number, then
   * the number aligns with an enum in the front end. That would keep everything very light. We could then hold a postgres array
   * Ã  la (10, 15, 24, 68, 111, 2, 43, ...) which we could just instantly decode via an enum.
